# Personal Scripts

> First of all.. WHY? 

- My pc has bdprochot, btw the cpu is stuck at 798mhz EVERYTIME ITS BOOT IN ALL OS, bcz of my power adpter is very very old, so using throttleStop i can modify the cpu clock to "normal" or use a higher clock with undervolt, and other stuff like: Memory Cleaner and ReviOS-Post install is include on this repo.

- This Scripts include Chocolatey and that help me ALOT, with chocolatey you can install any app, in my case "curl" with permitted to download all the stuff here.

- PHDGD Drivers, this is a modded Intel Graphics (in my case 2016 driver) my Intel 4400HD can give some improve of perfomance in this driver in old games or old directx games, bcz this 2016 can not afford with new games like Overwatch 2 (its crash on start) but i preffer using this type of driver.
