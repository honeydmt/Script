# Personal Scripts

> First of all.. WHY? 

- My pc has bdprochot, btw the cpu is stuck at 798mhz EVERYTIME ITS BOOT IN ALL OS, bcz of my power adpter is very very old, so using throttleStop i can modify the cpu clock to "normal" or use a higher clock with undervolt, and other stuff like: Memory Cleaner and ReviOS-Post install is include on this repo.

- This Scripts include Chocolatey and that help me ALOT, with chocolatey you can install any app, in my case "curl" with permitted to download all the stuff here.
